# MovieDB project

I like watching movies and documentaries. So I would like to build a movie database to rate the movie that I have watched.  
Users can add, remove, delete the movies in the database.(CRUD) They can also filte the result list.  
At first, the app will use local storage. Later, I will add database in the backend.
